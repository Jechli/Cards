ONE: Skills and expertise 

C++ is my main language, I was fond of it while taking my data structures course, and it is the 
language I am using now in my robotics team, SnowBots.

I am comfortable with Visual Studio. I learned to use it in a course I held a teaching assistant position for. 
It is the only IDE I've ever used with so many features for coding in C/C++ (debugging, 
auto-correcting, etc). 

I am not an expertise in any particular field of game programming, but I have a good foundation
in basic data structure and algorithm concepts.



TWO: Coding test

It is a Visual Studio 2012 project called 'CardGame'.
