1. 

C++ is my main language, I was fond of it while taking my data structures course, and it is the 
language I am using now in my robotics team, SnowBots.

I am comfortable with Visual Studio, I learnt it in a course I held a teaching assistant position for. 
It is the only IDE I've ever used with so many features for coding in C/C++ (debugging, 
auto-correcting, etc). If it is a very simple program I compile the code using Cygwin.

I am not an expertise in any particular field of game programming, but I have a good foundation
in basic data structures and algorithms.


2. Coding test: It is a Visual Studio 2012 project named 'CardGame'.
